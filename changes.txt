Removed lines from parser.y:
Written to keep just in case
VARDECL:
            | VAR VARLIST VARDECL                   {/* THIS IS MAYBE USELESS */ $$ = mknode("var", $2, $3);}
            | /* EMPTY */                           {/* THIS IS MAYBE ALSO USELESS */ $$ = NULL;}

In STATEMENT directive replaced EXPR with FUNCCALL

VARLIST, moved this kind of thing to PARAMLIST
            | ID ':' TYPE ';'                       {$$ = mknode("varlist", $1, $3);}

ASSIGNMENT, ID and LITERAL Can be treated as EXPR
              ID ASS ID ';'                         {$$ = mknode("=", $1, $3);}
            | ID ASS LITERAL ';'                    {$$ = mknode("=", $1, $3);}
            |
Was kinda reduntand with INNERBLOCK STATEMENT
            | INNERBLOCK INNERBLOCK                 {$$ = mknode("innerblock", $1, $2);}

Converted DECLARATION DECLARATION to  DECLARATION (VARDECL|FUNCDECL), final reduce/reduce stuff gone
